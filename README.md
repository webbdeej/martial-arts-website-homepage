# martial-arts-website-homepage
Copy of a homepage mockup from Themeforest: https://themeforest.net/item/knockout-martial-arts-psd-templates/13800401

I created this soon after learning CSS. I wanted to show that I can copy a website from sight. The page has some unusual overlapping of elements, as well as some odd parallelogram shapes and I wanted to see if I could replicate them.
